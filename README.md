# Insurance cost prediction
 Problem Statement:  
 
Insurance companies need to accurately predict the cost of health insurance for individuals to
set premiums appropriately. However, traditional methods of cost prediction often rely on broad
actuarial tables and historical averages, which may not account for the nuanced differences
among individuals. By leveraging machine learning techniques, insurers can predict more
accurately the insurance costs tailored to individual profiles, leading to more competitive pricing
and better risk management
